# Fortune for M5Stack

This repository contains an application for the M5Stack Core Fire which downloads and displays a fortune cookie.
It is intended to show how a program can access a JSON API and process its response.

* `Fortune v1.m5f` - sets up the strings for the URL
* `Fortune v2.m5f` - Prints the raw JSON response to the screen
* `Fortune v3.m5f` - Parses the JSON and prints just the fortune itself
* `Fortune v4.m5f` - Reloads a new fortune every 30 seconds
* `Fortune v5.m5f` - Displays the fortune with proper word wrapping

There is also a PDF with further details on the code.
